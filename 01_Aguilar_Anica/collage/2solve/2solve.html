  <body style="font-family:Courier;background-color:black;">
    <p style="color:white;">You pass through the columns and listen to what sounds like an argument in the distance. As you approach, you find two ghouls bickering amongst themselves.</p>
<br>
    <p style="color:white;">They are too busy to notice you, but you clumsily trip over a rock. They look straight at you -- fear runs through your veins, ready to defend yourself against the ravenous undead.</p>
<br>
    <p style="color:white;">Your feet find themselves moving towards them, as if they were possessed. You think that this must be the case.</p>
